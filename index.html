          <h2>Do you know what problems are costing your business time and money <strong>right now</strong>?</h2>
          <p>
            Most business owners can immediately point to one or more problems that, every single day, are <strong>costing them time and money</strong>. Do these sound familiar to you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We can&rsquo;t get the right information to the right people at the right time.</li>
            <li>We <strong>waste time</strong> redoing work because of disorganization and manual errors.</li>
            <li>We can&rsquo;t serve new customers because our current system can barely handle our current customers.</li>
            <li>My team spends more time doing data entry than adding value to my business.</li>
            <li>My team despises our current system. It&rsquo;s a <strong>constant source of frustration</strong> and a <strong>time suck</strong> for all of us.</li>
            <li>I&rsquo;m so busy working <em>in</em> my business, I don&rsquo;t have time to work <em>on</em> my business.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Imagine your business without those problems.</h2>
          <p>
            What would your business be like if you could say:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We have a <strong>smooth flow of information</strong>: exactly what each person needs, exactly when they need it.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>less mundane, redundant work</strong> and put our energy into serving our customers and doing great work.</li>
            <li>Bringing in new customers is <strong>frictionless</strong>. Sales and customer satisfaction are continually rising.</li>
            <li>Manual errors are caught when they happen. No more huddling over a report wondering which number is wrong or if that email actually got sent.</li>
            <li>Our system was built with a keen understanding of how we work. Team morale is up, wasted time (and money) is down.</li>
            <li><strong>I&rsquo;m free from many day-to-day issues</strong> which allows me to work on the overall vision and strategy for my business.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote><p>I solve the problems that are costing you time and money.</p></blockquote>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve spent years working with businesses and organizations of all sizes, from a one person business all the way up to the federal government. I&rsquo;ve learned how to enter a new environment, understand the business goals, and implement systems to improve efficiency and lower frustration.
          </p>

          <p>
            I solve your problems; software just happens to be my tool of choice. You and your business are the focal point:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You want to better serve your customers and see a resulting increase in profit.</li>
            <li>You want to understand what you&rsquo;re paying for without needing a four year degree in Computer Science.</li>
            <li>You want to make more money than you spend, all without adding more to your already overloaded plate.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote><p>I work with you to turn problems into paradise.</p></blockquote>
          <h2>&ldquo;Why do businesses avoid programmers like the plague?&rdquo;</h2>
          <p>
            Programmers are like mechanics. They muck around under the hood for a while and give you a large bill with a bunch of line items written in another language. Unfortunately, you have no idea if you&rsquo;ve overpaid for work that will leave you stranded on a deserted road in the middle of the night.
          </p>

          <blockquote><p>I do more than just deliver code and an invoice.</p></blockquote>

          <h2>Communication, not just code.</h2>
          <p>
            I work to deeply understand your needs and deliver solutions that meet those needs. When we talk, you&rsquo;ll hear terms like return on investment and opportunity cost. You won&rsquo;t have to wade through technical terms and acronym soup. I work to ensure my communication is just as high quality as my code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&rsquo;ll give you a view into the development process while making sure you don&rsquo;t get stuck in the weeds. With weekly milestones, you&rsquo;ll have a pulse on progress without adding more to your plate. Weekly billing means staying on schedule and budget with minimal surprises.
          </p>
